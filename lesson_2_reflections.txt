What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    The .git folder gets installed. It is necessary
    to begin detecting and tracking files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    You never really work from the staging area. It
    is valuable because it allows you to commit only
    one or some of the files at a time.
