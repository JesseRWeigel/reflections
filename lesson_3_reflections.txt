When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want a remote if:
      - You will be working from multiple computers
      - More than one person will be working
      - You want to share/get input from others
      - You want a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If more than one person is working on a project
    pulling automatically may get confusing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones from one github repository to
    another. Branches are a line of commits that run
    parallel to each other. They are not entire repos
    like a fork or clone. A fork or clone can contain
    many branches.
