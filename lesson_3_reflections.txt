When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want a remote if:
      - You will be working from multiple computers
      - More than one person will be working
      - You want to share/get input from others
      - You want a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If more than one person is working on a project
    pulling automatically may get confusing.
