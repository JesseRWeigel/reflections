When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want a remote if:
      - You will be working from multiple computers
      - More than one person will be working
      - You want to share/get input from others
      - You want a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If more than one person is working on a project
    pulling automatically may get confusing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones from one github repository to
    another. Branches are a line of commits that run
    parallel to each other. They are not entire repos
    like a fork or clone. A fork or clone can contain
    many branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    You can edit it offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    I would probably use Google Docs or Cloud9.
    It would be easier to collaborate in real time
    with Google and Cloud9 and I could collaborate
    with people who don't know how to use Git. It would
    be harder to keep track of all the changes, track
    multiple files, and collaborate with lots of
    people on the same project.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    I would use a separate branch if I was working on a new version or feature. It has the benefit of
    allowing me to make major changes to my code while
    still keeping the master branch unchanged. I can
    have multiple versions of my code all at once.
    Working directly in the master branch does save
    you from having to merge later and works for small
    changes.
